# Serverless [FaaS] ðŸš€

**Working with `AWS Lambda` on _Cloud9_ environment**

Deployed serverless applications, using **`AWS Lambda`**. `AWS Lambda` is a compute service that lets you run code **without provisioning or managing servers**.

`AWS Lambda` executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

## Why FaaS?

- Higher developer ROI because server infrastructure management no longer required.
- More time focused on writing code, which leads to a higher developer velocity.
- Functional programming is a design well suited to distributed computing. Instead of scaling your entire application, you can scale your functions
  automatically and independently with usage.

_Deployed these two scripts `test.py` & `wiki_lambda_api.py` on **AWS Lambda** and integrated with them through the provided `API Gatway`_
