# Serverless [FaaS]

Deploy serverless applications, using **`AWS Lambda`**. `AWS Lambda` is a compute service that lets you run code **without provisioning or managing servers**.

`AWS Lambda` executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
